# Human Motion Simulator
A 2D human motion simulator implemented as a Python desktop app.

Done as a part of the bachelor thesis with the topic: **_Human motion modeling and data generation tool for tracking algorithms development_**.

## Thesis Abstract
Acquiring data for development and testing of human motion tracking algorithms is difficult and costly. A good alternative would be to model human motion
and generate the data instead. However, the intrinsic complexity of the human behaviour makes it a challenge to develop a model of human motion. From many
various approaches tackling this problem, the Headed Social Force Model has been chosen as the main algorithm for creation of a program for generating simulation
data for the testing of a tracking algorithm that takes an input in the form of projections of humans moving thought the indoor environment onto the ground.
The advantage of the Headed Social Force Model lies in offering a set of parameters that can be explicitly configured and as a result human motion simulations can
be designed with a higher degree of variety. In order to simulate also complex scenarios, the human motion model is accompanied by a Probabilistic Roadmap
algorithm that computes feasible paths through an environment cluttered with obstacles, which are subsequently smoothed out by B-spline interpolation.

## Keywords
human motion, simulation, social force model

## Implementation
The simulator has following components:
- Headed Social Force Model for local path navigation  
- Probabilistic Roadmap algorithm for finding a global path
- Finite State Machine architecture for an agentâ€™s behaviour
